> I am a dedicated Python learner, presenting my personal projects.

> My journey just started a few months ago, after I decided to become competent in coding and starting a career in the tech industry.

> I create the content of this blog to showcase my growing skills, pointing out, what I specifically learned, what I liked about it and what I had difficulties with.

> My blog is not only intended to serve as a portfolio, but also for other young engineers, giving inspiration in clever coding, finding personal projects or simply start blogging about their own content.

> Shortly about me, I am an enthusiastic engineer/ scientist with backgrounds in mechatronic engineering and biomimetics. Learning and exploration are my passion.

> If you are interested in what I work on in my free-time, I would like to invite you, reading about the first steps I made, creating a simple [Pokémon game](https://felixboegge.github.io/FB/2022/08/05/The_Pokemon_Game.html).

> Furthermore, in case you have any questions, need some advice, or just want to talk, I would be happy if you reach out to me via one of the links below, preferably on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felixboegge/).
